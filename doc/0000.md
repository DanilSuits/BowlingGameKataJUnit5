Failures (1):

    => org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <300> but was: <0>
```

## Summary

The beginning of test calibration; I'm making sure that the test is
actually measuring the production implementation correctly.

As is my habit, I skip quickly past all of the "failures" associated
with having an implementation that gets rejected by the compiler.

## Lessons

Because the `VeeTwo.Game` interface is trivial, I can stub out
an implementation with a lambda, which I find much more succinct
than writing up a boilerplate anonymous class.
