# GREEN

## Summary

I don't really need to be separating out `VeeOne.legacy` and `VeeOne.adapter`;
the point is to have an easy way to shift back and forth between the two
implementations if anything goes sideways when I try to experiment.

In particular, I know that the legacy test suite passes using the legacy
implementation, and that the new test suite passes with the new implementation.

What I'm curious about: does the new implementation pass the legacy suite -
it might not if there's an odd edge case that I missed along the way.

## Lessons

Take smaller, easily reversed steps when the footing is uncertain.
