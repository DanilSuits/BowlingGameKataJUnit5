## Summary

The inner test at this point demonstrates the basic idea that I had
started with; simply convert the existing inputs to that expected
by the legacy implementation, and then hand off the calculation.

That isn't going to work, under the current constraints....

Tim dropped his implementation into an unnamed package, so
I can't get at it easily.  If I had also put my implementation
into that same package, I'd probably be fine -- but I was
"worried" about name collisions.

So I got lessons instead.
