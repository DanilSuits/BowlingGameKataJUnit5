## Conclusions

There's still a lot of "make the code beautiful" left to do, which
is beyond the scope of this exercise.

It would be pretty straight forward to cobble together an adapter
that plays the role of a `VeeOne.Game` API while using the Legacy
implementation.  Consider it an exercise for the student.

Ultimately, we'd want to make a choice one way or the other -

Right now, we have _two_ authorities for "how to score a bowling game",
so I don't think we are quite at the done stage yet.

`VeeOne.Game` and `VeeTwo.Game` are interesting, in so far as they
have the same signature, and even the same _units_, but different
_semantics_; I don't think you can substitute one for the other,
in a lambda, for instance, and get sensible results.
