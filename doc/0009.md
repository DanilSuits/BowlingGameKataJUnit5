## Summary

Passing, but there are a couple of things that I notice
in passing.

First, that I had two introduce two different conditionals,
rather than just one, to get the calculations for pins knocked
down to work.  That implies, I think, that either there is
a simpler expression to describe what's going on, or that
there is an intermediate test that I missed somewhere along
the way.

Second, passing this test required fixing a previously undetected
fault in the implementation of `framePositions`.  Again, one can
infer that there was a simpler test available somewhere that
would have surfaced this error without requiring changes to
`pinsKnockedDown`.

Neither of these are critical -- trying to find the test
that introduces the smallest possible change may be an
interesting intellectual exercise, but the goal is to get to
a complete and verified implementation.
