## Summary

A "lift and shift" - I'm copying the implementation out of the
unnamed package so that I can create some separation between
the existing api and its implementation.  This allows me to
explore sharing that implementation with the new code
(which isn't possible while the implementation is in the unnamed
package).

As before, I'm just creating shunts around the original code.
Maybe with practice I'll come to do this in one move.
