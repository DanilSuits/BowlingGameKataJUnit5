# GREEN

## Summary

I've pushed forward, trying to prepare for the "next easy change".

I'm deliberately holding off on removing a lot of duplication,
especially among the literals, because I'm trying to get to the
point where I have a complete implementation (and more to the
point, a complete battery of tests) before I really start
moving things around.

I _think_ the existing logic is correct, for the case of a perfect
game.  At this point, I only have one test exercising this code,
so it should be "branchless", and it is.

The code currently has `TODO` markers in place at the locations
where I know I am cheating.  So the next stages of the exercise
should focus on discovering a progresion of failing tests
that force me to upgrade these implementations.

## Lessons

With only a single unit test, the cyclomatic complexity should be
one?
