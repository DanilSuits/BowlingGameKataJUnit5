# GREEN

## Summary

Again, the change is relatively straight forward, and introduces a branch.

I actually screwed this up on the first pass - I used the wrong array in
the predicate, which actually produced a non-zero score, just not the
one I was testing for.

I was actually quite confused until I saw that the IDE was reporting
an unused parameter.
