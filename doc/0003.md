# RED

## Summary

After some careful thought, the waiting items are

* The `pinsKnockedDown` logic is whacked for values other than 10 and 0.
* The `framePositions` logic isn't distinguishing strikes from spares
and open frames
* The `scoreInFrame` logic isn't managing open frames correctly.

I want to find a test case that touches one, but doesn't affect the
others.  My guess is that `scoreInFrame` is the easy one to attack;
a game that is perfect until the final frame, and then busts, isn't
going to run into either of the other issues.

I just need to make sure I compute the score correctly.  Instead
of going `30,30,30`, the last three frames should score `20,10,0`
which means giving up 60 points, so the correct score should be
240?

Of course, with the code written as is, what I actually run into
is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, rather than a bogus score.
