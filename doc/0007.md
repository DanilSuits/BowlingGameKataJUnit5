# GREEN

## Summary

That test was too complicated to get right.  So I'm going to disable
it and double back.

## Lessons

Maybe I need an AMBER to go with RED-GREEN - the state where
_all_ of the tests are passing isn't the same as a state where
there are disabled tests.

If I were willing to delete the test until I'm prepared for it,
rather than disabling it as here, then I wouldn't need a third
option.  On the other hand, assuming that the disabled tests
don't introduce compile errors, writing a disabled test
is a good way to capture ideas.
