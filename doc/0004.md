## Summary

It took me a while to come up with this test;  it looked to me
as though it were a coin flip between which of the two TODO
items should be knocked off next, so I guessed which one would
be simpler... then had a bear of a time figuring that I needed
to put the scoring rolls at the _end_ of the game, rather than
at the beginning.

The current implementation never looks past roll 12, regardless
of the scores, to all of the throws that it sees miss.
