## Summary

The test failed, but not quite the way I had expected.

Because of the incomplete implementation in `pinsKnockedDown`
the scoring logic things that the player knocked down 9+9
pins in the final frame, rather than 9+0.

What I hadn't realized is that the scoring routine would
consider that this is a "spare", and try to add in the
results of the bonus ball.

I think that's going to be fine, but if it isn't I
may need to disable this test and try a simpler alternative
first.
