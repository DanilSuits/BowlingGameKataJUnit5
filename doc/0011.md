## Summary

The easiest way to calibrate a test is to hard wire a wrong answer.

In this case, because the implementation is primitive obsessed, returning
a number that is out of the valid range is easy, and calibrates all
of the tests at once.

If I were dealing with an API that was using some sort of domain
specific value, rather than a primitive, there might be extra
hoop jumping required.

As far as I'm concerned, there's no particular value in trying
to find a precise calibration that leaves the other tests green.
All I'm trying to establish is that the test is evaluating the
production code as a whole; not that a test is exploring a
specific code path.
