# GREEN

## Summary

With no obvious tests to write, I start tacking toward a common implementation.

The first step, I think, is to separate the two different representations of
the scores.  Rather than a single monolith scorer, I can think about one that
translates the new readings to the old representations, and then defering
the remaining work to something that knows the algebra of knocking down pins.

In this case, I do the refactoring in two steps - first, I extract a new class 
to take on the separate responsibility, and use a shunt to delegate the work
to the new class.

When that is verified, I can remove the dead code.
